## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Setup your environment**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure SagittaDB is installed
   pip install -e .
   
   # Navigate to examples
   cd examples
   ```

2. **Run basic example**:
   ```bash
   python basic_usage.py
   ```

3. **Explore other examples**:
   ```bash
   # Try the e-commerce demo
   python ecommerce_demo.py
   
   # Test performance
   python performance_benchmark.py
   
   # Explore in-memory usage

   ```

## üìä Generated Files

Running the examples will create various database files:

- `example_basic.db` - Basic usage example data
- `example_advanced.db` - Advanced querying example data
- `ecommerce_products.db` - E-commerce product catalog
- `ecommerce_orders.db` - E-commerce order data
- `benchmark_file.db` - Performance benchmark data
- `legacy_system.db` - Migration example legacy data
- `new_system.db` - Migration example new schema
- Various backup files (`.db` and `.json` formats)

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Each example is designed to be educational and modifiable:

- **Modify data sizes**: Adjust `num_docs`, `num_queries`, etc. in examples
- **Change scenarios**: Modify the sample data to match your use case
- **Add new operations**: Extend examples with additional SagittaDB features
- **Performance testing**: Adjust benchmark parameters for your system

## üìö Learning Path

**Recommended order for learning**:

1. **Start with basics**: `basic_usage.py`
2. **Learn advanced features**: `advanced_querying.py`
3. **See real-world usage**: `ecommerce_demo.py`
4. **Understand performance**: `performance_benchmark.py`
5. **Explore in-memory**: `in_memory_usage.py`
6. **Master data management**: `migration_backup.py`

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Common issues**:

- **Permission errors**: Ensure write permissions in the examples directory
- **Module not found**: Make sure SagittaDB is installed (`pip install -e .`)
- **Database locked**: Close any existing database connections
- **Performance issues**: Adjust example parameters for your system

## üí° Tips

- **Clean up**: Remove generated `.db` files between runs if needed
- **Experimentation**: Modify examples to test different scenarios
- **Performance**: Use in-memory databases (`:memory:`) for temporary testing
- **Debugging**: Add print statements to trace execution flow
